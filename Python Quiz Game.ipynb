    "The Interactive Python Quiz Game is a text-based application that presents a series of multiple-choice questions to the user. The game provides instant feedback on each answer and keeps track of the user's score throughout the quiz. This project can be further enhanced with additional features such as random question order, a timer for each question, high score tracking, and a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like tkinter."
